## Currently available versions are in bold <br />

v3.0: <br />
This version added the ability for the bot to skip new words. I built my versions of the bot using this code as a base. <br />

v3.5: <br />
This version made it so the bot defaulted to being on. It also added some QoL improvements with the buttons.  <br />

### v3.9: <br /> This version was a remade version of the 3.5 build, updated to contain new console messages and fix some simple bugs. <br />

v4.0: <br />
This was the first version with the 90% correct system. A little bit clunky and in need of some fixes.  <br />

v4.01: <br />
This version shuffled around some button functions and improved the base 90% system. <br />

v4.02: <br />
This version added new console status updates to make the operation of the bot easier to understand. <br />
Note: With the introduction of v4.1, this version is basically useless because of its outdated systems. <br />

v4.1: <br />
This version added some random deviation to the answer accuracy. At the beginning of the session the bot picks a random percentage between 89% and 94% to target for question accuracy. The bot will get roughly the defined percentage of questions correct, adding some randomness to your session accuracy. Some console updates were also implemented. <br />
Note: Due to the limited amount of questions in a regular 15 min session, the actual accuracy can deviate from the target accuracy by a couple percentage points. <br />

v4.11: <br />
The bot will now rescan the page if it cannot find a question to answer quickly enough. This will prevent getting stuck on loading screens and new words. It will also print the time (in seconds) until the question is answered directly to the console. <br />

v4.12: <br /> Streamlined the console so the user won't get redundant messages. <br />

### v4.13: <br /> While the previous accuracy range was between 94% and 89%, the time limitation on Membean meant that you would get pretty consistent 90's and 88's. To counter this, I made the accuracy range far more unpredictable (78%-93%), which makes it seem as if the user is actively learning new words and mastering them. This change also has the upside of giving you less new words, which is nice. Finally, I restructured the way that the accuracy target is determined, because honestly the old method sucked ass. <br />
