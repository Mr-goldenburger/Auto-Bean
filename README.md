This is a bot used to automate the process of Membean, the online vocab tester. <br />
This bot is only to be used on training sessions, not quizzes. <br />
Feel free to submit bug reports or troubleshooting help to the issues tab. <br />
<br />

**HOW TO USE:** <br />
1. Open the most recent/desired version and copy the code <br />
    - To find more specific info on what each version changes, check the UpdateLog.md file. <br />
2. Open membean and once you are on the "session duration" screen, use Ctrl + Shift + I to open the console <br />
3. Paste the code into the console but DO NOT PRESS ENTER <br />
4. Begin your session <br />
5. As soon as you begin the session, click into the console and press enter. The bot will automatically activate and will start reporting info to the console <br />

**CONTROL:**  <br />
The bot creates two buttons at the bottom left of the screen, these buttons will disappear once you end the session. <br />
Button #1: Defaults to "On", if set to "Off" it will stop the bot. <br />
Button #2: Defaults to "Skip: On", will "wait out" some questions in order to fabricate a lower accuracy score. <br />
If set to "Skip: Off" the bot will answer every question correctly. <br />
<br />

Github Navigation: <br />
Tested versions are posted on the main branch (Alongside the ReadMe and UpdateLog), while untested and unfinished builds are posted on the In-Progress Builds folder. <br />
<br />

Browser compatibility:  <br />
If you cannot open the console, you might want to consider switching to a 3rd party browser such as Opera GX to avoid restrictions set by system admins. <br />
